  This is an article snippet--it's just a more readable version of the 
    article in the db.json file, but this file itself is not used at 
    all in the final code.

  Don't forget to escape double quotation marks! Or just stick to single
    quotes.

  - compile all code into one line before putting into db.json
  - add 'article-image' class to images/videos for proper style
  - all text must be in <p>
  - escape double quotes! Shoul avoid using them whenever possible.

  Hey, thanks for stopping by. Paper Drip is just a funky little website built by a single guy who loves origami. It originally came about as a coding project, but it ended up really reconnecting me with a hobby I've loved since childhood. I post about tutorials, tips and tricks, or discoveries about paper crafting. It's a one-person show, so be aware of slower updates than you're used to for regular content. Thanks for checking this out!
