  Hey, thanks for stopping by. Paper Drip is just a funky little website built by
   a single guy who loves origami. It originally came about as a coding project,
   but it ended up really reconnecting me with a hobby I've loved since childhood.
   Here, I post little blurbs on the blog section with cool new techniques or origami
   discoveries. I plan on sharing a few models I've designed as well, starting
   with a <strong>gridless</strong> angled rose, definitely inspired by Toshikazu
   Kawasaki's model. It's a one-person show, so I'm really flattered you checked
   this out, let alone clicked on and actually read this welcome article!
